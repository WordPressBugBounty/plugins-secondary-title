Secondary Title is a simple, lightweight plugin that allows you to easily add an alternative title to posts, pages, and/or custom post types.

== Description ==

**Secondary Title** is a simple, light-weight plugin that adds an alternative title to posts, pages, and/or [custom post types](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types), which can be displayed automatically, with a shortcode or by using PHP.

The plugin comes with an extra settings page, which allows you to customize the plugin according to your needs. You can change:

* [post types](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types), categories, and specific post IDs the secondary title will be
shown on,
* whether the secondary title should be automatically added to the standard title (*Auto show*),
* the format both titles are being shown (only works when *Auto show* is activated),
* the position where the secondary title input field should be displayed (above or below the standard title) within the admin interface (Classic Editor only),
* whether the secondary title should only be displayed in the main post and not within widgets, etc.,
* if the secondary title should be usable in [permalinks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks),
* and even more.

**Please see the [official website](https://docs.kolja-nolte.com/secondary-title/) for a full documentation.**

== Installation ==

= Quick Installation =

1. Install Secondary Title either by searching for the plugin with WordPress' native plugin installer found under *Plugins* <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">→</span> *Add New* or [download the plugin manually](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/secondary-title.zip) and copy the *secondary-title* folder into the */wp-content/plugins/* directory of your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin in the *Plugins* section of your admin interface.
3. Go to *Settings* <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">→</span> *Secondary Title* to customize the plugin as desired.

**IMPORTANT:** If the *Auto show* option is set to *Off*, you have to use either

`<?php echo get_secondary_title($post_id, $prefix, $suffix); ?>`

or

`<?php the_secondary_title($post_id, $prefix, $suffix); ?>`

in your theme file(s) (e.g., *single.php*) where you would like the secondary title to be displayed.

**For more detailed documentation with parameters, functions, and examples, please see the [official documentation](https://docs.kolja-nolte.com/secondary-title/)**.
